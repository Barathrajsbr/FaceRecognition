# FACE RECOGNITION
The Face Recognition can be done by Computer Vision with combined Deep Learning techniques to produce accurate results.

# FrameWork and Libraries used
* NumPy
* OpenCV(library)
* Tensorflow
* Keras

# Installing library
* pip install opencv-python
* pip install tensorflow
* pip install keras
* pip install fer
* pip install py-agender

# Steps
   **Using Google Colab** 
1. Updating the path of the image 
2. Adding Models and Classifiers to the Googlecolab Files
3. Run the  colab notebook 
4. Then it uses Tensorflow has a backend to Recognize the face and corresponding age,gender,emotion,skin color of the person present in the image is produced as output
with skin colorbar
